# Frontend Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of frontend-backend integration for the Investigator Assistant system, including the Investigation Room and Knowledge Graph & Analysis interfaces.

---

## Implemented Components

### 1. **New Pydantic Models** (`agent/models.py`)

Added request/response models for the new endpoints:

#### Investigation Room Models:
- `QASubmissionRequest`: Request for Q&A submission
  - `question: str` - The question asked
  - `answer: str` - The suspect's answer
  - `session_id: Optional[str]` - Optional session tracking

- `QASubmissionResponse`: Response with suggested questions
  - `suggestedQuestions: List[str]` - 3-5 follow-up questions
  - `graphUrl: str` - URL to graph visualization
  - `analysis: Optional[str]` - Analysis text
  - `session_id: Optional[str]` - Session tracking

#### Analysis Chat Models:
- `AnalysisChatRequest`: Request for analysis assistant
  - `prompt: str` - User's question/instruction

- `AnalysisChatResponse`: Response from assistant
  - `answer: str` - AI assistant's response

#### Graph Visualization Models:
- `GraphNode`: Node representation for visualization
- `GraphEdge`: Edge representation for visualization
- `GraphVisualizationData`: Complete graph data structure
- `InvestigationAnalysis`: Structured analysis output

---

### 2. **Updated System Prompt** (`agent/prompts.py`)

Added `INVESTIGATION_QA_PROMPT` - specialized prompt for Q&A analysis that:
- Instructs the agent to format output consistently
- Searches for contradictions with previous statements
- Identifies missing information (unnamed people, times, places)
- Detects ambiguous references
- Generates 3-5 specific follow-up questions

**Output format enforced:**
```
**Analysis:**
[Brief analysis text]

**Suggested Questions:**
1. [First question]
2. [Second question]
3. [Third question]
...
```

---

### 3. **Graph Visualization Module** (`agent/graph_visualization.py`)

New module for extracting and formatting knowledge graph data:

#### Functions:
- `get_graph_visualization_data(limit, session_id)`: Extract nodes and edges from Neo4j
- `get_recent_graph_changes(since_timestamp, limit)`: Get recently added entities
- `generate_graph_url(session_id, base_url)`: Generate URL for graph access
- `get_entity_subgraph(entity_name, depth, limit)`: Get graph centered on specific entity

#### Data Format:
Returns `GraphVisualizationData` with:
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "uuid", "label": "Mike", "type": "Person", "metadata": {...}},
    {"id": "uuid", "label": "Restaurant", "type": "Place", "metadata": {...}}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"from": "uuid1", "to": "uuid2", "label": "visited", "metadata": {...}}
  ],
  "metadata": {"total_nodes": 10, "total_edges": 8, ...}
}
```

---

### 4. **Investigation API Endpoints** (`agent/investigation_api.py`)

New module containing all investigation-specific endpoints:

#### Endpoint 1: POST `/investigation/submit-qa`
**Purpose**: Handle Q&A pair submission from Investigation Room

**Request:**
```json
{
  "question": "Where were you on Friday night?",
  "answer": "I was at a restaurant with Mike."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "suggestedQuestions": [
    "Which restaurant were you at?",
    "What time did you arrive and leave?",
    "What is Mike's full name?",
    "Who else was present at the restaurant?",
    "What did you discuss with Mike?"
  ],
  "graphUrl": "http://localhost:8058/graph/data?session_id=abc123",
  "analysis": "The answer lacks specific location, time, and full identity details...",
  "session_id": "abc123"
}
```

**What it does:**
1. Adds Q&A to knowledge graph as Graphiti episode
2. Extracts entities and relationships automatically
3. Runs agent analysis to find gaps/contradictions
4. Extracts 3-5 suggested questions using regex patterns
5. Generates graph visualization URL
6. Returns structured response

#### Endpoint 2: POST `/analysis/chat`
**Purpose**: Handle stateless chat from Analysis Assistant

**Request:**
```json
{
  "prompt": "Tell me about Mike and his connections"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Based on the interrogation transcripts, Mike appears in multiple statements..."
}
```

**What it does:**
1. Creates temporary session (no history maintained)
2. Runs agent with full tool access (vector, graph, hybrid search)
3. Returns response text directly
4. Session is not persisted

#### Endpoint 3: GET `/graph/data`
**Purpose**: Retrieve graph visualization data

**Query Parameters:**
- `session_id` (optional): Filter by session
- `limit` (default: 50): Max nodes to return

**Response:**
```json
{
  "nodes": [...],
  "edges": [...],
  "metadata": {"total_nodes": 25, "total_edges": 18, ...}
}
```

---

### 5. **Question Extraction Logic** (`investigation_api.py`)

Implemented `extract_questions_from_text()` function that handles multiple formats:

**Supported formats:**
- Numbered: `1. What time did this happen?`
- Bulleted: `- What time did this happen?`
- Standalone: `What time did this happen?`

**Features:**
- Regex-based extraction with multiple patterns
- Duplicate removal while preserving order
- Max question limit (default: 5)
- Handles various numbering styles (1., 1), etc.)

**Fallback strategy:**
If structured output fails:
1. Parse agent's text response manually
2. Extract questions using regex
3. Provide default questions if none found

---

### 6. **API Integration** (`agent/api.py`)

Updated main API to include new routers:
```python
app.include_router(investigation_router)  # /investigation/*
app.include_router(analysis_router)       # /analysis/*
app.include_router(graph_router)          # /graph/*
```

Updated app metadata:
- Title: "Investigator Assistant - Agentic RAG with Knowledge Graph"
- Description: Reflects interrogation transcript analysis focus

## Data Flow

### Investigation Room Flow:
```
Frontend: User submits Q&A
    ↓
POST /investigation/submit-qa
    ↓
Backend:
  1. Add Q&A as Graphiti episode (with entities/relationships)
  2. Run agent analysis with INVESTIGATION_QA_PROMPT
  3. Extract questions from response (regex patterns)
  4. Generate graph URL
  5. Return QASubmissionResponse
    ↓
Frontend: Display suggested questions, store graph URL
```

### Analysis Chat Flow:
```
Frontend: User sends chat message
    ↓
POST /analysis/chat {"prompt": "Tell me about Mike"}
    ↓
Backend:
  1. Create temp session (no history)
  2. Run agent with prompt
  3. Agent uses vector/graph search as needed
  4. Return response text
    ↓
Frontend: Display in chat interface
```

### Graph Visualization Flow:
```
Frontend: Requests graph data
    ↓
GET /graph/data?limit=50
    ↓
Backend:
  1. Query Neo4j for entities and relationships
  2. Format as GraphVisualizationData
  3. Return nodes/edges JSON
    ↓
Frontend: Render using D3.js/vis.js/cytoscape.js
```

## Frontend Integration Notes

### For Investigation Room UI:

**On Q&A Submit:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8058/investigation/submit-qa', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({question, answer})
});

const data = await response.json();
// data.suggestedQuestions = array of 3-5 questions
// data.graphUrl = URL to graph visualization
// data.session_id = session tracking
```

### For Analysis Chat UI:

**On Chat Message Send:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8058/analysis/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({prompt: userMessage})
});

const data = await response.json();
// data.answer = AI assistant's response text
```

### For Graph Visualization:

**Fetch Graph Data:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8058/graph/data?limit=50');
const graphData = await response.json();

// graphData.nodes = [{id, label, type, metadata}, ...]
// graphData.edges = [{from, to, label, metadata}, ...]

// Use with D3.js, vis.js, cytoscape.js, etc.
```

---

## Error Handling

All endpoints return standard HTTP error responses:

**400 Bad Request:** Invalid input (empty question/answer, etc.)
```json
{
  "detail": "Field cannot be empty"
}
```

**500 Internal Server Error:** Processing failed
```json
{
  "detail": "Failed to process Q&A submission: [error details]"
}
```

Frontend should handle these cases and display appropriate user messages.

---

## Logging

All endpoints log key events:
- Q&A submission received
- Analysis completion with question count
- Graph data requests
- Errors with full stack traces

Check logs for debugging:
```bash
# Logs show request details and processing steps
2025-01-XX INFO: Received Q&A submission: Q='Where were you...' A='I was at a...'
2025-01-XX INFO: Successfully added Q&A to knowledge graph
2025-01-XX INFO: Analysis complete, found 5 questions
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Q&A Processing Time:
- **Typical**: 3-10 seconds
- **With Graphiti**: 5-15 seconds (entity extraction is computationally expensive)
- Consider showing loading state in UI

### Graph Data Retrieval:
- **Small graphs (<100 nodes)**: <1 second
- **Large graphs (>500 nodes)**: 2-5 seconds
- Use `limit` parameter to control response size

### Concurrent Requests:
- System supports multiple concurrent Q&A submissions
- Each gets isolated session
- Connection pooling handles database load

---

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)

Items marked as "not implemented" in the plan:

1. **Write Tests**: Unit and integration tests for new endpoints
2. **API Documentation**: Enhanced OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add throttling for expensive operations
4. **Caching**: Cache graph data with TTL for performance
5. **Async Task Queue**: For long-running graph operations
6. **Authentication**: User authentication and authorization
7. **Logging Dashboard**: Centralized logging and monitoring
